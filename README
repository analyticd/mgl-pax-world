## Basics

Not that there is room here to be non-basic in any way.

- [function] UPDATE-PAX-WORLD &KEY (SECTIONS (DEFAULT-SECTIONS)) (PAGE-SPECS (DEFAULT-PAGE-SPECS))

    Generate HTML documentation for all SECTIONS. By default, files are
    created in *PAX-WORLD-DIR*. For projects with repositories on
    github, links to sources on github are added via the :SOURCE-URI-FN
    mechanism of DOCUMENT.
    
    In the absence of :HEADER-FN :FOOTER-FN, :OUTPUT every spec in
    PAGE-SPECS is augmented with HTML headers, footers and output
    location specifications (based on the name of the section).
    
    If necessary a default page spec is created for every section.

- [variable] *PAX-WORLD-DIR* "- the root of the MGL-PAX-WORLD ASDF system -"

    Returns the default list of sections for which UPDATE-PAX-WORLD
    generates documentation.

- [function] DEFAULT-PAGE-SPECS
